Chrome extension, bookmark it and see it in a tab on the website [mrvdlei](https://x.com/mrvdlei/status/1743349379627438277?s=20)

I have a few ideas.
1- To be able to note on each design (for example what I like about them)
2- Categorize them with labels (So I can add one inspiration to multiple categories)
3- Share
4- Filter based on labels

I'd love to apply logic to my bookmarks and tags for example. Personally I manage mine on notion and usually put them into knowledge collections after I have worked with them. 
Also a reminder to go over them regularly, sometimes it takes me months to review and delete old ones [Fabbaist](https://x.com/Fabbaist/status/1743336575449383175?s=20)
